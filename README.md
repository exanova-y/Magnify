# Magnify

## What is it?   
A physics simulation program regarding the behaviour of light rays passing through a magnifying glass. It calculates the light energy converted into heat energy and simulates a fire if the temperature of the object exceeds its ignition temperature. 

## Calculations

My team used a simplified formula to compute the temperature increase based on one photon per second.   
Then we scaled it up by factors e.g. number of photons per meter per second, the surface area of the magnifying glass and conversion efficiency.   

## Skills Involved
